            <h3>Top 5 Longevity Habits of a 98-Year-Old Man Who Got Me on the Path Of Fitness.</h3>

            
            
            <div class="blog1">
                <strong>A lesson in fitness from the most self-disciplined man.</strong>
                <p>
                    The person who ignited my passion for fitness is a 98 years old ex-air force officer who fought in
                    the 1962 Sino-Indian war. He embodies self-discipline and perseverance.
                    He is a close family friend so we call him Dadaji(Grandpa).
                    He taught me handstands when I was seven. He used to organize fun park activities during the summer
                    holiday.
                    Going to park with him at the crack of dawn made me the fitness junkie that I am today.
                    At the age of 98, he still goes to the park daily for his morning walks. He is free of all chronic
                    and mental diseases.
                    A knee ache is his only trouble. Here are the top five activities that have added a couple of
                    decades to his life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    1. Practice fitness like your life depends on it
                    As an ex-airman man fitness is his lifestyle. He has built all his fitness habits on the foundation
                    of a simple morning walk.
                    There could be a reigning zombie apocalypse, but that man would still find a way to go to the park
                    every morning.
                    Walking is his life.
                    It’s never too late to make fitness your priority. Start small by going on a walk daily.
                    Aim for 7000 steps. Add some bodyweight exercise in the mix as well. Here is a 20-minute workout
                    routine that you can follow easily.
                    Warm-up with a 5-minute walk.
                    10 minutes power walk.
                    20 squats
                    20 push-ups
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. The diet to longevity
                    Grandpa is a strict vegetarian who follows intermittent fasting to a tee.
                    He eats dinner before sunset daily.
                    Challenge your body and will with intermittent fasting.
                    Start with a 12-hour fast as it is the easiest way to adopt this diet. Follow this rule daily. There
                    is no exception on rest or cheat days.
                    After you get comfortable with this routine, try a 14 hour fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Swap your protein source
                    Adding plant-based protein to your diet can reduce the risk of death. So, start with one meal a day.
                    Switch your morning eggs scramble with a tofu scramble. Or your dinner steak with quinoa and lentil
                    salad.
                    Here is a short article to help you debunk some myths about plant-based protein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Build a community around your passion
                    Grandpa has friends of all ages. He is friends with everyone including children, youngsters, and the
                    oldies.
                    Find a topic that you can talk about for hours. It cannot be news or conspiracy theories.
                    Once you have found the topic that you love, find some people who are also crazy about it. Talk,
                    argue, and debate with them on daily basis.
                    Build a community who people who share your passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Don’t forget about your mental health
                    Grandpa has been meditating since his thirties. He always ends his morning fitness routine with
                    meditation. He sits on his favorite spot, close his eyes, and just breathes.
                    I am not going to bore you with the benefits of meditation that you have already read 15,643 times.
                    What you can do
                    You need a passion for fitness to live a long healthy life. Grandpa’s dedication and self-discipline
                    have paid off well. It is a miracle to be disease-free at the age of 98.
                    Follow his sage advice to add a few decades to your life.
                    Do a physical activity daily.
                    Fast daily for at least 12 hours.
                    Add more plant-based protein sources to your diet.
                    Build a community of people to fuel your passion.
                    Meditate daily for at least 5 minutes.
                    
                </p>
